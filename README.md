A scalable MVP platform for chess coaches to deliver custom content (PGN/FEN lessons and puzzles), connect with players, assign content, track progress, and communicate in real-time.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **Chess Logic**: chess.js
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Supabase account (free tier works)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
cd /home/salim/Desktop/coachess
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

2. Go to **Project Settings** â†’ **API** and copy:
   - Project URL
   - Anon/Public key
   - (Optional) Service role key for admin operations

3. Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

In your Supabase project dashboard:

1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run the migration files in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/003_seed_data.sql` (optional, adds test data)
